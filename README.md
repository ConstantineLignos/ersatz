# Ersatz: Multi-lingual Language Model Based Sentence Boundary Detection

This repository uses the AWD-LSTM language model as a default; thus, the repository contains refactored versions of much of the code that can be found [here](https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm). For further reading, see these two [Salesforce Research](https://einstein.ai/) papers:
+ [Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182)
+ [An Analysis of Neural Language Modeling at Multiple Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08240)
This code was originally forked from the [PyTorch word level language modeling example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model).
